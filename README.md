Here is an **c++** implemention of realistic rendering engine using **Monte Carlo Path Tracing**.

- Input a 3D scene, output a picture of that scene.
- Using Monte Carlo integration to solve rendering equation.
- Implementation of Light Source sampling strategy.
- Using BVH tree to accelerate intersection detecting.
